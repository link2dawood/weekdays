// Finnish school holidays (koulujen loma-ajat) — D-04.
//
// Covers the current school year plus the next: 2026–2027 and 2027–2028
// (as of 2026-07-23, the currently-running school year is mid-summer-break
// between years, so "current" is treated as the imminent 2026–2027 year).
//
// Sourced from official municipal/national records, not memory or blog
// posts, per the handoff's explicit warning — school holiday dates change
// year to year and this is exactly the kind of thing easy to get subtly
// wrong. Checked 2026-07-23:
//   - 2026–2027: Opetushallitus (oph.fi) national announcement, cross-
//     checked against Helsinki's official city decision record
//     (paatokset.hel.fi/fi/asia/hel-2025-015947) — both agree.
//   - 2027–2028: Helsinki's official decision record (same URL, which
//     covers both years) for school-year bounds, syysloma, joululoma, and
//     the Etelä-Suomi (South Finland) hiihtoloma week specifically.
//
// Confidence is NOT uniform across every field below — see the inline notes
// on hiihtoloma for 2027–2028 specifically, where two of the three regions
// are inferred rather than independently re-confirmed for that exact year.
